-- Universal Script Hub - Fixed Version
-- This works with the updated key system that creates UI directly after validation

-- Load your UI library
local Lynk = loadstring(game:HttpGet("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/vvisuall/lynkUI/refs/heads/main/source"))()

-- Create window - the key system will handle everything else
local Window = Lynk:CreateWindow({
    Name = "Universal Script Hub",
    Title = "LYNK | No.1 Scripthub", 
    Subtitle = "Find any script for any game | Made by @x_vvw on Discord",
    Accent = Color3.fromRGB(88, 101, 242),
    DefaultKeybind = Enum.KeyCode.Insert
})

-- Removed all references to Show methods - using direct activation instead
-- The key system now creates the main UI directly after validation
-- No Show methods needed - everything is handled with direct visibility and activation
